## Data

Source of information is from the UNECE website: http://www.unece.org/tradewelcome/areas-of-work/un-centre-for-trade-facilitation-and-e-business-uncefact/outputs/cefactrecommendationsrec-index/list-of-trade-facilitation-recommendations-n-21-to-24.html

All data from UNECE has to be available in an easily distributable format, in this case it is an .xls file to process I simply removed any lines with a status of 'X' and removed the numeric code column as it's of little useable value

Meaning of status codes:

A plus sign (+) Added. New unit added in this release of the code list.;
A hash sign (#) Changed name. Changes to the unit name in this release of the code list;
A vertical bar (¦) Changed characteristic(s). Changes other than to the unit name in this release of the code list, e.g. a change to the numeric code.
A letter X (X) Marked as deleted. Code entries marked as deleted will be retained indefinitely in the code lists. When appropriate, these entries may subsequently be reinstated via the maintenance process;
An equals Reinstated. Code entries previously sign (=) Marked as deleted and reinstated in this release of the code list.

Requests for addition to the codes should be made to the Information Content Management Group (ICG) at cefact@unece.org
